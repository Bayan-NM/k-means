Implementing the k-means Clustering Algorithm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains code for Implementing the k-means Clustering Algorithm.
The cluster is implemented in Python and utilizes the NumPy,and Matplotlib libraries.

The code provides the following:

1. Load GloVe Embeddings https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip.
2. Load EVALution relation classification use train.tsv 
2. Implement k-means clustering algorithm and Cluster word pairs into k clusters.
3. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score of the cluster.
4. Vary the value of k and evaluate the performance.
5. Normalize feature vectors for clusters.


##Usage

1. Prepare your dataset .
2. Update the file paths in the code to point to your data files.
3. Run the code and observe the clustering results and performance metrics.


##View the results:

• The code will output the number and type of classes, number of training instances per class, number of testing instances per class and show a plot the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score .
• Additionally, it will generate a plot showing after the normalization.
